# Task 6: Reflection

# I learned how to load csv files into data frames and retrieve data from them using pandas and other operations.
# I strengthened my understanding of different operations, such as finding maximum or minimum values to determine various fields with top players or schools. 
# With the grouping functionality, I also learned how to group certain players together to analyze the statistics per school. 
# This was really interesting to see since it allowed us to create insights into the backgrounds of certain players and which tend to do the best or worst for instance. 
# Some other operations I polished where using techniques such as loc[] and nlargest() to filter the dataset into specific components we wanted to narrow down to. 
# All of these techniques could be used in various real-world datasets such as within fields of healthcare, finance, business, and anything that involves data.

# One challenging aspect of the assignment was the very introduction, which I faced a problem when reading the data frame. 
# The columns were not displaying as I expected them to, and my solution was to add a parameter for "header=1" after my csv path. 
# It seemed simple but was an effective tweak to correctly read the column names which will be useful to keep in mind whenever I come across data formatting that might not always be perfect. 
# It is always important to read the headers and columns to see how the data is structured before diving into analysis.

# The insights I gained from analyzing these basketball statistics can be translated into many other datasets such as customer demographics, marketing sales, hospital patient records, school grades, and many more. 
# All the techniques such as finding max/min, filtering, grouping, and visualizing trends can be used to discover patterns and make decisions based in data. For example, a company could use the max/min information to determine best-selling products to maximize their profits by focusing their resources around that, and divest or move out of markets that are not doing as well. 
# Overall, this assignment helped me practice certain aspects of retrieving and analyzing data and using various techniques and operations to further inspect any patterns and visuals for proceeding with a decision, and this is applicable in many fields.
